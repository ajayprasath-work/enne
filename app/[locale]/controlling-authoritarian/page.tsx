            Be an involved leader, not a controlling authoritarian
          </div>
          <div className="text-lg mt-8">
            Being a leader is not easy. Balancing your own motivations and ways
            of working with that of a diverse team is a challenging task. This
            week we look at body-centred leaders â€“ types 8, 9 and 1 who pride
            themselves as being involved, and in control of their environment
            and team.
          </div>
          <div className="text-lg mt-8">
            As their base emotion is anger, it influences their actions in aims
            of taking control and to always be present with their team. When an
            external force messes with them and they lose control, or if someone
            interferes with their presence within the team, they can be angered.
            These leaders take pride in their work and use their gut to
            influence their decision making.
          </div>
          <div className="text-lg mt-8">
            <span className="font-bold">Type 1 Perfectionist</span> leaders work
            hard with their team and are dependable at all times. They set high
            expectations not just for others but for themselves as well which
            could lead them to be self critical and rigid in their ways.
          </div>
          <div className="text-lg mt-8">
            <span className="font-bold">Type 8 Challenging</span> leaders are
            like guardians where they protect their team with passion and
            fairness. They are not afraid in holding their ground of what they
            believe is truth. Their defensive instincts are also attributed to
            the fact that they fear vulnerability.
          </div>
          <div className="text-lg mt-8">
            <span className="font-bold">Type 9 Peacemaking</span> leaders
            prioritize maintaining peace and harmony within their teams and puts
            others before themselves. As such, they can become indecisive when
            needing to make difficult decisions as they know that not everyone
            will be happy. Nonetheless, this open-minded and caring nature that
            holds them back in difficult decisions, makes them excellent
            mediators in conflict.
